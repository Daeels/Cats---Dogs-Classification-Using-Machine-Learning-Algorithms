# Cats and Dogs Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms 🐱🐶 

This repository contains code for classifying images of cats and dogs using machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction 🚀

In this project, we explore the problem of image classification, specifically the task of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. We explore several different machine learning algorithms for this task, including:

- K Nearst Neighbor (KNN)
- Decision Trees

We compare the performance of these algorithms using various metrics that you can find in the report.

## Note 📝
In general, machine learning algorithms are not well-suited for image processing and classification tasks. However, deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are more effective and yield better performance in this type of problem.
